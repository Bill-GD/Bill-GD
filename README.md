## Hi, i'm An.

The full name is Nguyá»…n VÄ©nh An (or Nguyen Vinh An).  
I'm 22 (at the time of writing) and currently is a final-year university student majoring in Computer Science.  
My usual online username is `billgd` or just `bill`, hence the GitHub username (please don't ask why I made it, it's embarrasing ðŸ™‚).  

I started learning coding by myself (outside of school) in 11th grade (2019-2020) with C++ but I gradually moved away from it.
In university, I started learning JavaScript, Dart, Python, Java, PHP.

Currently, I mainly use JavaScript and its ecosystem for web development.
For mobile development, I chose Flutter instead of React Native and Java. Although, I'm open to learning Kotlin since I mainly develop Android apps.

For specific tech/framework, right now I'm focusing on learning and using ExpressJS/NestJS and MySQL for backend,
Svelte/SvelteKit and TailwindCSS for frontend.

### Current tech stack:

- Programming languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart (open to Kotlin)
- Other languages: HTML, Markdown, CSS
- Frontend frameworks: Svelte, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap (open to Vue and Nuxt)
- Backend frameworks: NestJS/ExpressJS, Flutter
- Database: MySQL (open to NoSQL like Firebase...)
- ORM: Drizzle, TypeORM
- VCS: Git/GitHub
